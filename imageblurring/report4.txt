Dimensions:
I have not used resize function in cv2 to make the dimensions smaller on the beatles.jpg picture.
I did not see it necessary or obligatory in the assignment text to resize the picture dimensions, 
so the dimensions of the image being blurred are therefore: 480 (H), 640 (W), and 3 (C).

Runtime:
Runtime Cython using unvectorized blur algorithm with 1 blur cycle takes arround 0.040 seconds.
Runtime Cython using vectorized blur algorithm with 1 blur cycle takes arround 0.030 seconds.

Comparisons:
Unvectorized algorithm:
Cython is approximately 112.5 times faster then the standard python. 
Cython is as fast as numpy used with vectorized algorithm.
Cython is approximately 11.25 times faster then Numba. 
Vectorized algorithm:
Cython looks to be a little faster, 1.33 times, than Numpy.
Cython is approximately 25.67 times faster then Numba. 

Conclusion:
Advantage: 
Cython is the fastes choise. Cython is generating heavly optimized C code for both the
unvectorized, and vectorized algorithm. Cython can interract with other c files and import c files as modules.
Disadvantage:
Cython requires a compiler, and requires that the .pyx file is compiled. 
Not all python code is easly compiled out-of-the-box.
It also requires more though into type declaration in the code.
